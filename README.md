A goal-driving, self-motivated software engineer recently graduated from Makers Academy. My background in fashion marketing has equipped me with problem-solving and communication skills, as well as thinking creatively. I am a fast learner and an excellent team player. 

Jumping into technology has been the most exciting but challenging decision of my journey. After working in marketing and retail, I wanted to break out of my comfort zone and learn something new. Being a software developer combines all my passions: constantly learning and always challenging myself, designing and building features/products on online platforms, and working with people. I would love to work in a supportive environment where I can push myself to the next level.
