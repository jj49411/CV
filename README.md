I am a goal-driven, self-motivated software engineer recently graduated from Makers Academy. My background in fashion marketing has equipped me with problem-solving and communication skills, as well as thinking creatively. I am a fast learner and an excellent team player. 

Jumping into technology has been the most exciting but challenging decision of my journey. After working in marketing and retail, I wanted to learn something new and break out of my comfort zone. Being a software developer combines all my passions: constantly learning, always challenging myself, designing and building features/products on online platforms, and working with people. I would love to work in a supportive environment where I can add value and push myself to the next level.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving and Adaptability 

My experience in Marketing has enabled me to look at problems with multiple perspectives and come up with possible solutions quickly. Throughout my coding journey, I managed to pick up new languages and frameworks in a short timeframe (Javascript, Rails). For my final project, I learned completely new mobile application and testing frameworks (React Native, Jest) with making 3 external API calls.<br>
In Makers, the training of ‘learn as you build’ has equipped me to tackle brand new problems on a daily basis. I’ve developed a strict TDD process that makes me approach a problem logically and methodically. Debugging an error actually brings me closer to understanding a system!


#### Excellent Communication 

During my time in the customer-facing roles, I’ve developed strong communication skills and active listening techniques. Being an open-minded person, I value any feedback and am not afraid of asking questions. In makers, we work in agile workflow which involves constant communicating and effective time boxing.

#### Design Skills
Programming is a way to demonstrate creativity as we can approach a problem in so many different ways. Coming from a design background, I have a passion to build something aesthetic but also useful. One of my goals in my final project was to make the interface user-friendly, visually-stimulating and themed appropriately to match the purpose of the app. I achieved it by creating an excellent UI/ UX design and converted it into code.<br>
I’m always thinking from user’s perspectives and evaluating my actions that make positive impact on those who use the product.

#### Team-player
Working in a team was definitely the most enjoyable part throughout Makers. I believe that leaning from others is the quickest way to improve both technical and people skills. Previously working in a marketing team has trained me for being flexible and responsible. I continue to apply them in the Makers group projects in agile teams.
